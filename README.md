I'm doing this for my ICS presentation. But I hope that I will have more future usage of this strong tool.
well, actually I begin to feel the interesting aspects of giving a presentation. It actually forces me to learn something really new and beyond the textbooks.

The only disadvantage may be that the process is time-consuming.
